Stream 1:

What is JavaScript?

In December 1995, soon after releasing JavaScript for browsers, Netscape introduced an implementation of the language for server-side
scripting with Netscape Enterprise Server.

Since 1996, the IIS web-server has supported Microsoft's implementation of server-side JavaScript.
-- JScript -- in ASP and .NET pages.

Since the mid-2000s, additional server-side JavaScript implementations have been introduced, such as Node.js in 2009.

Then There comes Variable and Data types

SO there are 5 types of datatypes in JavaScript:-
1.Number - decimal or integer
2.String - Letters
3.Boolean - True or False
4.Undefined - datatypes without any value
5.Null - No datatypes

In JavaScript we don't have to declare the datatypes that we are trying to get output of!

//USING Prompt:-{This section helps you to understand how prompts works, so what is prompt in JavaScript?,
                The prompt() method displays a dialog box that prompts the visitor for input.

                A prompt box is often used if you want the user to input a value before entering a page.}

//USING ALERT:-{This section helps you to understand how prompts works, so what is alert in JavaScript?,

    Dialog box or alert message in JavaScript. Dialog boxes are methods of the window object.
 However, we can invoke them without explicit reference to window.
 They may be used depending on the type (alert, confirm, prompt) to display an information or
 to get input from the user.}

Stream 2:

Operators :-Operators in JavaScript follows the old school BMDAS rule. As follows:-

Parentheses	    ()
Incrementation	++
Decrement   	--
Exponentiation	**
Multiplication	*
Division	    /
Addition	    +
Subtraction	    -

SO that's how it's done{USING OPERATORS};
